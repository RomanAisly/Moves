# 🎬 Films

An elegant, modern Android application for discovering movies, watching trailers, and finding
streaming providers. Built entirely with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, following the
principles of **Clean Architecture**, **State-Driven Navigation**, and an **Offline-First**
approach.

## ✨ Features

* **Adaptive UI (Tablets & Foldables):** Fully optimized for large screens using **Material 3
  Adaptive**. Dynamically switches between single-pane (phones) and dual-pane (
  `ListDetailPaneScaffold`) layouts depending on the window size, providing a desktop-class
  experience.
* **State-Driven Navigation (Navigation 3):** Cutting-edge routing approach using
  `androidx.navigation3`. Complete removal of `NavController` in favor of pure Kotlin State (
  `List<NavKey>`). Seamless tab state restoration using `SavedStateConfiguration` and
  `kotlinx.serialization`.
* **Modern UI/UX:** Built with Jetpack Compose. Immersive Edge-to-Edge design with custom shadows,
  spring animations (`animateBounds`), and translucent glass-morphism effects.
* **Offline-First:** Movies are cached locally using **Room** with automated schema migrations (
  `AutoMigration`). Instant loading from the database with smart background synchronization.
* **Reactive State Management:** Powered by `StateFlow` and `SharedFlow`. Safe handling of UI events
  and automatic cancellation of outdated network requests (`flatMapLatest`).
* **YouTube Trailer Integration:** Watch official movie trailers directly inside the app.
* **Watch Providers:** Discover where to legally stream, rent, or buy movies in your country (
  powered by JustWatch).
* **Dynamic Theme & Localization:** Seamless switching between Light/Dark themes and languages (
  EN/RU/etc.) on-the-fly using `DataStore` and `CompositionLocal` without Activity recreation.

## ⚙️ Project Architecture

The project is strictly modularized by layers, enforcing the Dependency Inversion Principle and
encapsulation (`internal` modifiers):

* `:domain` (Pure Kotlin): The heart of the app. Contains business models, abstract repository
  interfaces, and pure Enums. Has zero Android dependencies.
* `:data` (Android Library): Handles remote (Ktor) and local (Room) data sources. Implements the
  `:domain` interfaces. Network DTOs and Database Entities are kept `internal` to prevent leaking
  into the UI.
* `:ui` (Android Library): Contains Jetpack Compose screens, ViewModels, Adaptive Scaffolds, and
  UI-specific mappers. Depends only on `:domain`.
* `:app` (Android App): The lightweight shell (Entry Point). Connects all modules together,
  initializes Koin, and sets up the root `NavDisplay`.
